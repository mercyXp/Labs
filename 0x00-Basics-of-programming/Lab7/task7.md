# LABORATORY WORK No.7

- Both tasks should be implemented in ONE project in the console mode of the MS Visual Studio system.

- *Task 1: CALCULATING FUNCTION VALUES* Write a program to calculate the values of the function at ten equally spaced points in the interval (0, 4] for possible values of the argument x.The program should receive the starting point of the interval for the argument as input. The results of the calculations should be displayed on the screen in a readable format without using formatting parameters.

- *Task 2: FIBONACCI NUMBERS* Write a program to calculate S – the sum of the first N Fibonacci numbers. The calculations should continue until the sum exceeds a pre-specified large number `MAX`.The program should receive the value of `MAX` as input. The results should show the values of ~N~ and ~S~.
