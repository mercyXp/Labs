# COMPILER DESIGN
Compiler Design is a branch of computer science that focuses on developing software tools (compilers) that translate programs written in high-level programming languages (like C++ or Python) into machine code that a computer can execute. It encompasses the theory, design, and implementation of compilers, breaking down the process of translation into well-defined stages.
